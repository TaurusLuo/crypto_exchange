        <h1>Corporate Vision</h1>
        <p>The vision of our platform is different; we are focused on building a community non-bank for the blockchain era,
            which will eventually become a one-stop shop for all financial services. Brick and mortar banks have become just
            institutions with very little depositor transparency, “fine print” with increasing regulations, high fees to
            access your capital, increased penalties, and monthly account service fees. As a digitize virtual community non-bank
            financial institution, we will be able to take back control of our money. We are dedicated to bringing our real-life
            finance skills and expertise to our global user friendly community platform. As supply and demand are created
            with opportunities to digitize common everyday assets, more cryptocurrency will be designed to monetize profits
            for our community members. We will become a top cryptocurrency fintech non-banking company in the world in the
            next 3 years
